After hearing this troublesome issue times from developers, finally, I have encountered it now. My developer account was notified to be terminated on September 26th.

This will cause all my apps to be removed from AppStore.

### About me

I am Liu Qia, an indie developer.

Because of love, I started indie development at the end of 2018, and put a lot of effort into it during almost all my time after work.

### About my apps in the developer account

There are currently 8 apps. Among which the "RedLine" (aka 红线) is from January 2019 to the present, there are more than 280k users, and they have been featured by AppStore Today many times, as well as by multiple media.

Other apps are not very influential, mostly when I have been inspired by something or when they meet a certain demand, I made them.

Of course, whether "love" or "good apps" is not a criterion for whether an account should be terminited.

There should be rules.

This is also the point where I am confused.

### The incident

For more than a year, my apps' reviews and account status are all very good. Until two weeks ago, I submitted a newly developed app called "One Aim". This is a simple, clean, single-function app. Like my other works, I did it myself from design to development.

The review of the initial version submission went smoothly, and it passed the review within a day and was released on the AppStore.

Then I found some UI problems (you can easily find out if you download the app). After making minor changes, I submitted the 1.0.1 version for review.

On the evening after submission, the app changed status to "in review". Two days later, the review was rejected, and a notice was received saying that the review needs to be extended, and no details were given.

By the morning of September 23, I received a notice saying that my developer account or other accounts associated with the account were fraudulent, and decided to terminate it. You can appeal within 14 days.

I find it incredible.

First of all, I am very clear that my account, apps, and any of my actions taken have never violated the Apple Developer Guide or other relevant regulations.

Secondly, I learned from the incidents of other developers that if they were notified to terminate the account, at least the specific reason related to the app would be notified in the notice of rejection of the app review.

But in my case, the last notice just extended the review. The next one is to terminate the account.

Then I filed an appeal within an hour.

On the same day, I also spoke with Apple’s support on phone, and the she said that they would report my situation to the review team and asked me to wait for a reply.

On the morning of September 26, I received a notice that the investigation was over and the termination was confirmed.

I don’t understand what makes Apple think that my apps or my account must be terminated without communication. Even if you can see from various historical records,  what a conscientious and never-violating developer has done, nor does it provide Any details.

I have always agreed with Apple's serious review of Apple. Apple's good ecology and serious review of apps are inseparable.

But now I am very chilling.

### I hope

I believe that most indie developers are making apps for their passion. They can't make a lot of money after completing all the roles by one person, just because they are worthy of their love.

We hope to contribute more enthusiasm to indie developer. We should not be treated like this.

I can accept that I will be punished for any violations. In fact, I feel that a developer knows whether he violates the rules, so I don’t understand the their decision.

I hope someone can tell me what the reason is and solve it reasonably. Instead of accepting any blows from the sky like this.

I also hope to get your help, I will update the progress, if possible, thank you for your reposting and sharing, or if there is a way to help me, thank you for contacting me at bravesummer.liu@gmail.com.

Thank you.
