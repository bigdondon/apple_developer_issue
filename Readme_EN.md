After hearing that many developers have encountered this troublesome problem, finally, I have encountered it now. My developer account was notified to close on September 26th.

### about me

I am Liu Qia, an independent developer.

Because of love, I started independent development at the end of 2018, and put a lot of effort into it.

### About my work in the developer account

There are currently 8 models, among which the "red line" is from January 2019 to the present. There are more than 280k users, and they have been recommended by AppStore Today many times, as well as by multiple media.

Other works are not very influential, mostly when they are inspired or when they meet a certain demand.

Of course, whether it is love or good work is not a criterion for whether an account should be closed.

This is also the point where I am confused.

### This incident

For more than a year, my app review and account status are all very normal. Until two weeks ago, I submitted a newly developed app called One Aim. This is a simple, clean, single-function app. Like my other works, I did it myself from design to development.

The review of the initial version submission went smoothly, and it passed the review within a day and was released on the AppStore.

Then I found some UI problems (you can easily find out if you download the app). After making minor changes, I submitted the 1.0.1 version for review.

On the evening after submission, the app changed status to "under review". Two days later, the app was rejected, and a notice was received saying that the review needs to be extended, and no details were given.

By the morning of September 23, I received a notice saying that my developer account or other accounts associated with the account were fraudulent, and decided to close it. You can appeal within 14 days.

I find it incredible.

First of all, I am very clear that my account, app, and any of my actions have never violated the Apple Developer Code or other relevant regulations.

Secondly, I learned from the incidents of other developers that if they were notified to close the account, at least the specific reason related to the app would be notified in the notice of rejection of the app review.

But in my case, the last notice just extended the review. The next step is to close the account.

So I filed a complaint within an hour.

On the same day, I also spoke with Apple’s support phone, and the other party said that they would report my situation to the review team and asked me to wait for a reply.

On the morning of September 26, I received a notice that the investigation was over and the shutdown was confirmed.

I don’t understand what makes Apple think that my app or my account must be shut down without communication. Even if you can see from various historical records, a conscientious and never-violating developer, nor does it provide Any details.

I have always agreed with Apple's serious review of Apple. Apple's good ecology and serious review of apps are inseparable.

But now I am very chilling.

### I hope

I believe that most independent developers are making apps for their passion. They can't make a lot of money after completing all the roles by one person, just because they are worthy of their love.

I can accept that I will be punished for any violations. In fact, I feel that a developer knows whether he violates the rules, so I don’t understand the account closure.

I hope someone can tell me what the reason is and solve it reasonably. Instead of accepting any blows from the sky like this.

I also hope to get your help, I will update the progress, if possible, thank you for your forwarding, or if there is a way to help me, thank you for contacting me at bravesummer.liu@gmail.com.

Thank you.
